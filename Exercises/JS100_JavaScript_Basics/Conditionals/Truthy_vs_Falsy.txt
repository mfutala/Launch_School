Without looking at your notes or MDN, try to recall all values that count as falsy in JavaScript.

Discussion
In JavaScript, there are only eight values that are falsy (In a boolean context). They are:

===============================================
0
false
undefined
null
NaN
'' or "" (Empty Sting)

-0 (negative zero)
0n (BigInt zero)

===============================================

The last two items on this list are not discussed in this course, so don't worry if you didn't know those.
