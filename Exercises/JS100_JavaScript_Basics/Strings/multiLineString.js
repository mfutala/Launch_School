/*
Multiline String
Take the following rhyme:

Copy Code
A pirate I was meant to be!
Trim the sails and roam the sea!
How can you assign this string to a single variable, preserving the line break?

let newString = "\nA pirate I was meant to be!\n" + "\tTrim the sails and roam the sea!";

console.log(newString);
